`Domain Name System` `(DNS)` is an essential part of the Internet. It translates human-readable domain names such as `academy.hackthebox.com` or `www.hackthebox.com` into their corresponding `IP addresses` assigned by hosting providers. `DNS` has no central database; instead, it operates as a globally distributed network of `name servers`. Conceptually, it functions like a library containing multiple phone books, each holding a portion of the overall directory. These distributed servers control which `web server` a user reaches for a given domain.

| **Server Type**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DNS Root Server`              | The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe. |
| `Authoritative Nameserver`     | Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point. Based on the country, company, etc., authoritative nameservers provide answers to recursive DNS nameservers, assisting in finding the specific web server(s).                                              |
| `Non-authoritative Nameserver` | Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Caching DNS Server`           | Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Forwarding Server`            | Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Resolver`                     | Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
`DNS` traffic is typically unencrypted, allowing local networks and `ISPs` to intercept or monitor queries. To mitigate this, encryption standards such as `DNS over TLS (DoT)`, `DNS over HTTPS (DoH)`, and `DNSCrypt` secure communication between clients and `name servers`.

Beyond resolving names to `IP addresses`, `DNS` also provides metadata about domain services, such as identifying the `mail server` (`MX record`) or listing the `authoritative name servers` for a given domain.

![[{6FDB9C20-B30E-488D-A38C-C05292C6664B}.png]]

Different `DNS records` are used for the DNS queries, which all have various tasks. Moreover, separate entries exist for different functions since we can set up mail servers and other servers for a domain.

| **DNS Record** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`            | Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `AAAA`         | Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `MX`           | Returns the responsible mail servers as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `NS`           | Returns the DNS servers (nameservers) of the domain.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `TXT`          | This record can contain various information. The all-rounder can be used, e.g., to validate the Google Search Console or validate SSL certificates. In addition, SPF and DMARC entries are set to validate mail traffic and protect it from spam. |
| `CNAME`        | This record serves as an alias for another domain name. If you want the domain www.hackthebox.eu to point to the same IP as hackthebox.eu, you would create an A record for hackthebox.eu and a CNAME record for www.hackthebox.eu.               |
| `PTR`          | The PTR record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names.                                                                                                                                     |
| `SOA`          | Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact.                                                                                                                                            |

# Default Configuration

`DNS` servers use three main configuration file types that define their functionality and data structure:

- `local DNS configuration files`
	control global and zone-specific behavior of the `DNS` service.
- `zone files
	contain `resource records` for each domain, such as `A`, `MX`, or `NS` records.
- `reverse name resolution files  
	map `IP addresses` back to `domain names` for reverse lookups.

The `Bind9` server, common on Linux systems, uses configuration files like `named.conf.local`, `named.conf.options`, and `named.conf.log`. The primary file `named.conf` defines both **global options** and **zone options**.

Global options apply to all zones, defining general server behavior.  
Zone options apply only to their respective domains and override global settings when conflicts occur.  

Unlisted options default to predefined `Bind9` values.

#### Local DNS Configuration

Within `named.conf`, different `zones` are defined and linked to their respective `zone files`. Each `zone file` typically manages one `domain`, except in cases like `ISP` or `public DNS` servers that handle multiple domains. Various configuration `options` can be applied to extend or restrict server functionality, all documented in the official `Bind9` references.

```bash
root@bind9:~# cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local

//
// Do any local configuration here
//

// Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
// organization
//include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";
zone "domain.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.domain.com";
    allow-update { key rndc-key; };
};
```

#### Zone Files

A `zone file` is a text-based configuration file defining a `DNS zone` using the `BIND` format, the standard across modern `DNS` servers. It represents a point of delegation within the `DNS hierarchy` and fully describes its assigned zone.

Each `zone file` must contain exactly one `SOA record` and at least one `NS record`. The `SOA` record appears first and defines the zone’s authority parameters. Any syntax error renders the file invalid, causing the `name server` to return a `SERVFAIL` response as if the zone did not exist.

All forward `resource records` (e.g., `A`, `AAAA`, `MX`, `CNAME`) are written in this `BIND` format, mapping `domains` and `hostnames` to their corresponding `IP addresses`—functioning as the DNS equivalent of a phone book.

```bash
root@bind9:~# cat /etc/bind/db.domain.com

;
; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
;
$ORIGIN domain.com
$TTL 86400
@     IN     SOA    dns1.domain.com.     hostmaster.domain.com. (
                    2001062501 ; serial

                    3600       ; retry after 1 hour
                    604800     ; expire after 1 week
                    86400 )    ; minimum TTL of 1 day

      IN     NS     ns1.domain.com.
      IN     NS     ns2.domain.com.

www          IN     CNAME   server2
```

# Dangerous Settings

`DNS` infrastructure is frequently targeted; public trackers like `CVEdetails` and `SecurityTrails` catalog common `BIND9` exploits. Misconfigurations and temporary workaround changes that prioritize functionality over security are primary attack vectors. Small config errors or overly-permissive options can expose zones to injection, cache poisoning, zone transfer abuse, and information disclosure. Regular auditing, strict zone option hardening, and minimizing emergency relaxations reduce `attack surface` and accidental `vulnerabilities`.

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`allow-query`|Defines which hosts are allowed to send requests to the DNS server.|
|`allow-recursion`|Defines which hosts are allowed to send recursive requests to the DNS server.|
|`allow-transfer`|Defines which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the DNS server.|
|`zone-statistics`|Collects statistical data of zones.|

---

# Footprinting the Service

`Footprinting` `DNS` servers is driven by the `queries` you send. Use the `NS` record and specify the target server with `@` to enumerate known `name servers`. Discovered `name servers` can be queried directly and may return different `resource records` or host additional `zones`; they can be configured differently or be `authoritative` for other delegations, revealing further `attack surface`.

Sometimes it is also possible to query a `DNS` server's version using a class CHAOS query and type `TXT`. However, this entry must exist on the `DNS` server. For this, we could use the following command:

#### DIG - Version Query

We can use the option `ANY` to view all available records. This will cause the server to show us all available entries that it is willing to disclose. It is important to note that not all entries from the zones will be shown.

#### DIG - AXFR Zone Transfer

A `zone transfer` refers to the synchronization of `DNS zone` data between servers, typically using `TCP port 53`. The full transfer process is known as `AXFR` (Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone). Its purpose is to ensure identical `zone files` across multiple `name servers` for redundancy and reliability.

The `primary name server` holds the original zone data, while `secondary name servers` replicate it to improve load distribution and fault tolerance. `Zone transfers` use shared authentication (e.g., `rndc-key`) to verify communication between trusted `master` and `slave` servers.

Only the `primary/master` server allows creation, modification, or deletion of entries—either through manual file edits or automated `dynamic updates`. The `slave` server periodically checks the `SOA record` from its `master` during the `refresh interval`. If the master’s `SOA serial number` is higher, the slave initiates a new transfer to update its data and maintain consistency.

#### DIG - AXFR Zone Transfer - Internal

If the `allow-transfer` directive is misconfigured—set to `any` or an entire `subnet`—it exposes the `zone file` to anyone. This allows unauthorized `AXFR` queries that can reveal complete `DNS records`, internal `hostnames`, and `IP addresses` from all accessible `zones`. Such exposure provides a detailed network map and is a critical `information disclosure` vulnerability.

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ dig axfr internal.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128

The individual `A` records with the hostnames can also be found out with the help of a brute-force attack. To do this, we need a list of possible hostnames, which we use to send the requests in order. Such lists are provided, for example, by [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt).

#### Subdomain Brute Forcing

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ for sub in $(cat /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done

ns.inlanefreight.htb.   604800  IN      A       10.129.34.136
mail1.inlanefreight.htb. 604800 IN      A       10.129.18.201
app.inlanefreight.htb.  604800  IN      A       10.129.18.15
```

Many different tools can be used for this, and most of them work in the same way. One of these tools is, for example [DNSenum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum).

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ dnsenum --dnsserver 10.129.14.128 --enum -p 0 -s 0 -o subdomains.txt -f /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt inlanefreight.htb
