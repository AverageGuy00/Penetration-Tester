`Microsoft SQL` (`MSSQL`) is `Microsoft`'s `SQL-based relational database management system`. Unlike `MySQL`, `MSSQL` is `closed source` and was originally developed for `Windows`. It has tight, native support for the `.NET framework`, which drives its popularity with `database administrators` and `developers` building `.NET` applications. While some `MSSQL` versions run on `Linux` and `macOS`, most `MSSQL instances` you encounter in the wild will be on `Windows` hosts.

#### MSSQL Clients

`SQL Server Management Studio` (`SSMS`) can be installed with the `MSSQL` package or separately. Itâ€™s often placed on the server for initial configuration and long-term `database` administration, but as a `client-side` tool it may also be installed on any admin or developer workstation. Hosts with `SSMS` and `saved credentials` present an attack vector: compromised or vulnerable systems can expose `database` access. The screenshot shows `SSMS` in use.

Of the `MSSQL clients` listed above, `pentesters` may find Impacket's `mssqlclient.py` to be the most useful due to SecureAuthCorp's Impacket project being present on many `pentesting` distributions at install. To find if and where the `client` is located on our host, we can use the following command:

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ locate mssqlclient

/usr/bin/impacket-mssqlclient
/usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/mssqlclient.py
```

#### MSSQL Databases

`MSSQL` has default `system databases` that can help us understand the structure of all the `databases` that may be hosted on a `target server`. Here are the `default databases` and a brief description of each:

| System Database |                                                                                              Description                                                                                               |
| :-------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    `master`     |                                                                        Tracks all system information for an SQL server instance                                                                        |
|     `model`     | Template database that acts as a structure for every new database created. Any setting changed in the model database will be reflected in any new database created after changes to the model database |
|     `msdb`      |                                                                   The SQL Server Agent uses this database to schedule jobs & alerts                                                                    |
|    `tempdb`     |                                                                                        Stores temporary objects                                                                                        |
|   `resource`    |                                                                 Read-only database containing system objects included with SQL server                                                                  |

# Default Configuration

When an admin enables network access the `SQL` service commonly runs as `NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER`. Client connections typically use `Windows Authentication` and, by default, `encryption` is not enforced for those connections, leaving traffic vulnerable unless `SSL/TLS` or server-side `Force Encryption` is configured.

When `Windows Authentication` is enabled, the `Windows OS` handles `login` requests through the local `SAM database` or the `domain controller` hosting `Active Directory`. This integration simplifies `auditing` and `access control` in Windows environments, but if an `account` is compromised, it can lead to `privilege escalation` and `lateral movement` across the `domain`.

To fully understand default configurations and potential `misconfigurations`, it is recommended to deploy `MSSQL` in a `virtual machine` for controlled installation and configuration testing.

---

# Dangerous Settings 

`Place ourselves in the perspective of an IT administrator` to anticipate `misconfigurations` that expose `servers` and `services`. High workload, tight deadlines, and numerous simultaneous projects make it easy for an admin to accidentally introduce a single `misconfiguration` that compromises a critical `server` or `service` on the `network`. This applies to any role, including `MSSQL` administration.

Testing installations in a `virtual machine` from install to configuration reveals default settings and common admin mistakes, improving detection of insecure deployments and reducing `attack surface`.

- `MSSQL clients` not using `encryption` to connect to the `MSSQL server`
- Use of `self-signed certificates` when `encryption` is enabled (possible to spoof)
- Use of `named pipes` for connectivity
- Weak or default `sa` credentials left enabled

---

# Footprinting the Service

Using `Nmap` against `TCP port 1433` revealed the target `hostname`, `database instance name`, and `MSSQL` `software version` the scan also shows `named pipes` are enabled. Record these discoveries in the engagement `notes` and treat them as unconfirmed until manually validated.

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap --script ms-sql-info,ms-sql-empty-password,ms-sql-xp-cmdshell,ms-sql-config,ms-sql-ntlm-info,ms-sql-tables,ms-sql-hasdbaccess,ms-sql-dac,ms-sql-dump-hashes --script-args mssql.instance-port=1433,mssql.username=sa,mssql.password=,mssql.instance-name=MSSQLSERVER -sV -p 1433 10.129.201.248

We can also use `Metasploit` to run an `auxiliary scanner` called `mssql_ping` that will scan the `MSSQL` service and provide helpful information in our `footprinting process`.

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/mssql/mssql_ping) > set rhosts 10.129.201.248

rhosts => 10.129.201.248


msf6 auxiliary(scanner/mssql/mssql_ping) > run

#### Connecting with Mssqlclient.py

If we can guess or obtain `credentials` we can remotely authenticate to the `MSSQL server` and operate against databases using `T-SQL` (Transact-SQL). Successful authentication grants access to the `SQL Database Engine` and lets an attacker enumerate and manipulate data from `Pwnbox` or a dedicated host using tools like `Impacket`'s `mssqlclient.py`. After connecting, the first step is to enumerate the `databases` to get a lay of the land for further discovery and exploitation.

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ python3 mssqlclient.py Administrator@10.129.201.248 -windows-auth
