`Server Message Block` (`SMB`) is a client-server protocol that regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network.

The SMB protocol enables the client to communicate with other participants in the same network to access files or services shared with it on the network.

In IP networks, SMB uses TCP protocol for this purpose, which provides for a three-way handshake between client and server before a connection is finally established.

An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined by Access Control Lists (ACL). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as execute,read, and full access for individual users or user groups.

# Samba

Samba implements the Common Internet File System (CIFS) network protocol. CIFS is a dialect of SMB. It is a specific implementation of SMB protocol. It allows Samba to communicate with newer Windows Systems. CIFS operates over TCP port 445.

# Default Configuration

Samba offers a wide range of settings that we can configure.

```bash
$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep -v "#\|\;" 

[global]
   workgroup = DEV.INFREIGHT.HTB
   server string = DEVSMB
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   max log size = 1000
   logging = file
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

   server role = standalone server
   obey pam restrictions = yes
   unix password sync = yes

   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

   pam password change = yes
   map to guest = bad user
   usershare allow guests = yes

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /var/lib/samba/printers
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
```

We see global settings and two shares that are intended for printers. Global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares.

| **Setting**                    | **Description**                                                       |

| `workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN` | Workgroup that will appear when clients query.                        |
| `path = /path/here/`           | The directory to which user is to be given access.                    |

| `guest ok = yes`               | Allow connecting to the service without using a password?             |
| `read only = yes`              | Allow users to read files only?                                       |
| `create mask = 0700`           | What permissions need to be set for newly created files?              |

| `magic output = script.out` | Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?            |

Each domain has at least one domain controller, usually a Windows NT server providing password authentication. This domain controller provides the workgroup with a definitive password server. The domain controllers keep track of users and passwords in their own `NTDS.dit` and `Security Authentication Module` (`SAM`) and authenticate each user when they log in for the first time and wish to access another machine's share.
