The `enumeration principles` are based on questions that facilitate investigations in any conceivable situation. In most cases the main focus of many `penetration testers` is on what they can see and not on what they cannot see. However, what we cannot see is still relevant and may be of great importance. Experience lets us start seeing components and aspects that are not visible at first glance.

- What can we see?  
- What reasons can we have for seeing it?  
- What image does what we see create for us?  
- What do we gain from it?  
- How can we use it?  
- What can we not see?  
- What reasons can there be that we do not see?  
- What image results for us from what we do not see?

An important aspect that must not be confused here is that there are always exceptions to the rules. The `principles` do not change. Another advantage of these `principles` is that we can see from practical tasks that we do not lack `penetration testing` abilities but technical understanding when we suddenly do not know how to proceed. Our core task is not to exploit machines but to find how they can be exploited.
