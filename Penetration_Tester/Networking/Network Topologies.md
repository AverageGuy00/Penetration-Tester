A network topology is the arrangement and connection of devices in a network, either physically or logically.

==***Physical topology***== describes the actual layout of the transmission medium (cabling plan, node positions, and connections).

==**Logical topology**== describes how data signals travel across the network and how devices communicate, regardless of the physical layout.

### **Repeaters**  
Devices that regenerate and amplify signals to extend the distance a network can cover without loss of quality. Operate at the **physical layer**.

### **Hubs**  
Basic devices that connect multiple hosts in a network and forward data to all ports. Operate at the **physical layer**.

### **Bridges**  
Devices that connect two LAN segments and filter traffic based on **MAC addresses**. Operate at the **data link layer**.

### **Switches**  
Advanced devices that forward traffic only to the intended recipient using **MAC addresses**. Operate at the **data link layer**.

### **Router/Modem**  
Routers connect different networks and route traffic based on **IP addresses**.  
Modems convert digital signals into analog for transmission over telephone or cable lines (and vice versa). Operate at the **network layer**.

### **Gateways**  
Translate between different network protocols or architectures, allowing communication across otherwise incompatible systems.

### **Firewalls**  
Security devices that monitor and control incoming/outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. Can be hardware, software, or both.
