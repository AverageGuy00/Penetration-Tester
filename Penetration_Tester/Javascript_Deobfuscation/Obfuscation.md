Obfuscation is a technique used to make a script more difficult to read by humans but allows it to function the same from a technical point of view, though performance may be slower. This is usually achieved automatically by using an obfuscation tool, which takes code as an input, and attempts to re-write the code in a way that is much more difficult to read, depending on its design.

Example = `console.log('HTB Javascript Deobfuscation Module')`

Result: 

```js
eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return c};if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--){d[c]=k[c]||c}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('1.0(\'2 3 4 5\')',6,6,'log|console|HTB|Javascript|Deobfuscation|Module'.split('|'),0,{}))
```
