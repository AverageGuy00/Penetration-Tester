`Fingerprinting` focuses on extracting technical details about the `technologies` powering a `website` or `web application`. Like a `fingerprint` uniquely identifies a person, the digital signatures of `web servers`, `operating systems`, and `software components` can reveal critical information about a target's `infrastructure` and potential `security weaknesses`. This allows `attackers` to tailor `exploits` specific to those technologies.

`Fingerprinting` is essential in `web reconnaissance` because it:

- Enables `targeted attacks` by identifying exact `technologies` and matching them to known `vulnerabilities` or `exploits`.
    
- Reveals `misconfigurations` or `outdated components` that other `reconnaissance` methods may miss.
    
- Helps `prioritise targets` by identifying systems more likely to be `vulnerable` or `high-value`.
    
- Builds a `comprehensive profile` of the `target` when combined with other `reconnaissance` data.
    

# Fingerprinting Techniques

- `Banner grabbing` – involves reading `banners` returned by `services` that may disclose `software` name and `version`.
- `HTTP header analysis` – inspects `headers` like `Server` or `X-Powered-By` for clues about underlying `technologies`.
    
- `Probing for specific responses` – sends crafted `requests` to trigger identifiable `error messages` or `version-dependent behaviours`.
    
- `Page content analysis` – examines `HTML` structure, `comments`, and `scripts` for signatures of `frameworks`, `CMS platforms`, or `technologies`.

`Fingerprinting` transforms general `reconnaissance` into `actionable intelligence`, enabling more precise `exploitation` and stronger `defensive mitigation`.

# Fingerprinting inlanefreight.com

### Banner Grabbing

Our first step is to gather information directly from the web server itself. We can do this using the `curl` command with the `-I` flag (or `--head`) to fetch only the HTTP headers, not the entire page content.

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ curl -I inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:07:44 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Location: https://inlanefreight.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

In this case, we see that `inlanefreight.com` is running on `Apache/2.4.41`, specifically the `Ubuntu` version. This information is our first clue, hinting at the underlying technology stack. It's also trying to redirect to `https://inlanefreight.com/` so grab those banners too

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ curl -I https://inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:12:12 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
X-Redirect-By: WordPress
Location: https://www.inlanefreight.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

We now get a really interesting header, the server is trying to redirect us again, but this time we see that it's `WordPress` that is doing the redirection to `https://www.inlanefreight.com/`

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ curl -I https://www.inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:12:26 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/7>; rel="alternate"; type="application/json"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/>; rel=shortlink
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

A few more interesting headers, including an interesting path that contains `wp-json`. The `wp-` prefix is common to WordPress.

### Wafw00f

`Web Application Firewalls` (`WAFs`) are security solutions designed to protect web applications from various attacks. Before proceeding with further fingerprinting, it's crucial to determine if `inlanefreight.com` employs a WAF, as it could interfere with our probes or potentially block our requests.

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ wafw00f inlanefreight.com

                ______
               /      \
              (  W00f! )
               \  ____/
               ,,    __            404 Hack Not Found
           |`-.__   / /                      __     __
           /"  _/  /_/                       \ \   / /
          *===*    /                          \ \_/ /  405 Not Allowed
         /     )__//                           \   /
    /|  /     /---`                        403 Forbidden
    \\/`   \ |                                 / _ \
    `\    /_\\_              502 Bad Gateway  / / \ \  500 Internal Error
      `_____``-`                             /_/   \_\

                        ~ WAFW00F : v2.2.0 ~
        The Web Application Firewall Fingerprinting Toolkit
    
[*] Checking https://inlanefreight.com
[+] The site https://inlanefreight.com is behind Wordfence (Defiant) WAF.
[~] Number of requests: 2
```

The `wafw00f` scan on `inlanefreight.com` reveals the site is protected by the `Wordfence` `Web Application Firewall` (`WAF`) developed by `Defiant`. This means the site has an additional security layer that could block or filter our `reconnaissance` attempts. In a real-world scenario, keep this in mind as you proceed with further investigation; you might need to adapt techniques to `bypass` or `evade` the `WAF`'s `detection mechanisms`

### Nikto

`Nikto` is a powerful open-source web server scanner. In addition to its primary function as a vulnerability assessment tool, `Nikto's` fingerprinting capabilities provide insights into a website's technology stack.

```bash
OathBornX@htb[/htb]$ nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b

The `-h` flag specifies the target host. The `-Tuning b` flag tells `Nikto` to only run the Software Identification modules.

`Nikto` will then initiate a series of tests, attempting to identify outdated software, insecure files or configurations, and other potential security risks.

The reconnaissance scan on `inlanefreight.com` reveals several key findings:

- `IPs`: The website resolves to both IPv4 (`134.209.24.248`) and IPv6 (`2a03:b0c0:1:e0::32c:b001`) addresses.
- `Server Technology`: The website runs on `Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)`
- `WordPress Presence`: The scan identified a WordPress installation, including the login page (`/wp-login.php`). This suggests the site might be a potential target for common WordPress-related exploits.
- `Information Disclosure`: The presence of a `license.txt` file could reveal additional details about the website's software components.
- `Headers`: Several non-standard or insecure headers were found, including a missing `Strict-Transport-Security` header and a potentially insecure `x-redirect-by` header.app
