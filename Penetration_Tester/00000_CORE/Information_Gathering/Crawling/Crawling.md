Crawling Overview

`Crawling` (also called `spidering`) is the automated process of systematically browsing the `World Wide Web`. Similar to how a spider navigates its web, a `web crawler` follows links from one page to another, collecting information. These `bots` use predefined `algorithms` to discover and index `web pages`, making them accessible through `search engines` or for tasks like `data analysis` and `web reconnaissance`.

How `Web Crawlers` Work

The operation starts with a `seed URL` — the initial page to crawl. The `crawler` fetches this page, parses its content, and extracts all links. It then adds those links to a queue and repeats the process iteratively. Depending on its configuration, the crawler can explore a single `domain` or a large portion of the `web`.

Homepage example:

```
Homepage
├── link1
├── link2
└── link3
```

Visiting link1:

```
link1 Page
├── Homepage
├── link2
├── link4
└── link5
```

The `crawler` systematically follows these links, gathering all accessible pages and their relationships. This differentiates `crawling` from `fuzzing`, which involves guessing potential links or directories.

Crawling Strategies

`Breadth-First Crawling`  
This method explores a website’s width before depth. It crawls all links on the `seed page`, then moves to the next layer of links. This approach is useful for mapping a site’s `structure` and `content overview`.

`Depth-First Crawling`  
This method prioritizes depth. The crawler follows one `path` as far as possible before backtracking. It is useful for locating specific `content` or exploring deep `directory structures`.

The strategy depends on the `reconnaissance` objectives.

Extracting Valuable Information

`Crawlers` can collect diverse data types relevant to `information gathering`:

- `Links (Internal and External)`: These are the fundamental building blocks of the web, connecting pages within a website (`internal links`) and to other websites (`external links`). Crawlers meticulously collect these links, allowing you to map out a website's structure, discover hidden pages, and identify relationships with external resources.
- `Comments`: Comments sections on blogs, forums, or other interactive pages can be a goldmine of information. Users often inadvertently reveal sensitive details, internal processes, or hints of vulnerabilities in their comments.
- `Metadata`: Metadata refers to `data about data`. In the context of web pages, it includes information like page titles, descriptions, keywords, author names, and dates. This metadata can provide valuable context about a page's content, purpose, and relevance to your reconnaissance goals.
- `Sensitive Files`: Web crawlers can be configured to actively search for sensitive files that might be inadvertently exposed on a website. This includes `backup files` (e.g., `.bak`, `.old`), `configuration files` (e.g., `web.config`, `settings.php`), `log files` (e.g., `error_log`, `access_log`), and other files containing passwords, `API keys`, or other confidential information. Carefully examining the extracted files, especially backup and configuration files, can reveal a trove of sensitive information, such as `database credentials`, `encryption keys`, or even source code snippets.
