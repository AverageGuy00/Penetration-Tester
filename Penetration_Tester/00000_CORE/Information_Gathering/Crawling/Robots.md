`robots.txt` is a simple text file located in a website’s root directory (e.g., `www.example.com/robots.txt`). It follows the `Robots Exclusion Standard`, which defines how `web crawlers` should behave when visiting a site. The file contains `directives` that specify which parts of the site `bots` can or cannot crawl.

## How robots.txt Works

Each directive in the file targets a specific user-agent — the identifier for a particular bot or crawler. Example:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/
```

This tells all user-agents (* as a wildcard) to avoid URLs under /private/. Other directives may allow access to certain directories, set crawl delays, or reference sitemaps to improve indexing efficiency.

## Understanding robots.txt Structure

The file consists of multiple records, each containing:

## User-agent — Specifies the targeted crawler or bot (e.g., Googlebot, Bingbot, or * for all).

Directives — Instructions defining what the user-agent can or cannot access.

### Common Directives

|Directive|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`Disallow`|Prevents a `bot` from crawling specific paths.|`Disallow: /admin/`|
|`Allow`|Permits a `bot` to crawl specific paths even if broader `Disallow` rules exist.|`Allow: /public/`|
|`Crawl-delay`|Adds a delay (in seconds) between requests to reduce `server load`.|`Crawl-delay: 10`|
|`Sitemap`|Points to an XML `sitemap` for efficient `crawling` and `indexing`.|`Sitemap: https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml`|

## Why Respect robots.txt

While `robots.txt` is not strictly enforceable (a rogue `bot` could still ignore it), most legitimate `web crawlers` and `search engine bots` respect its `directives`. This is important for several reasons:

- Avoiding `server overload` — Limiting `crawler` access helps prevent excessive traffic that could slow down or crash servers.  
- Protecting `sensitive information` — `robots.txt` can restrict indexing of private or confidential directories.  
- Ensuring `legal` and `ethical compliance` — Ignoring `robots.txt` may violate `terms of service` or `data protection` laws when accessing restricted or copyrighted content.

For `web reconnaissance`, `robots.txt` serves as a valuable source of intelligence. While respecting the `directives` outlined in this file, `security professionals` can extract critical insights into the structure and potential weaknesses of a target website.

Uncovering `hidden directories` — Disallowed paths in `robots.txt` often indicate directories or files the website owner wants to hide from `search engine crawlers`. These hidden areas might contain `sensitive information`, `backup files`, or `administrative panels` that could attract an `attacker`.

Mapping `website structure` — By analyzing both allowed and disallowed paths, `security professionals` can create a map of the website’s layout, revealing sections not linked from the main navigation and exposing undiscovered pages or functionalities.

Detecting `crawler traps` — Some websites include deceptive directories in `robots.txt` as `honeypots` to lure and identify malicious `bots`. Recognizing these traps can help assess a target’s `security posture` and `defensive awareness`.
