# Compliance Standards

Each regulatory body defines its own `information security` standards. The primary frameworks are `PCI DSS`, `HIPAA`, `FISMA`, and `ISO 27001`. These accreditations validate that an organization has undergone independent evaluation and meets required `security` and `compliance` benchmarks.

## PCI DSS

The `Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard` applies to entities that `store`, `process`, or `transmit` `cardholder data`. It enforces `internal` and `external scans` and segmentation of the `Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)` from standard assets.  
Goals include:  
Build and maintain secure networks, protect cardholder data, maintain a `vulnerability management` program, enforce `access control`, continuously `monitor and test`, and maintain an `information security policy`.

## HIPAA

The `Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act` secures `patient data`. It requires ongoing `risk assessments` and `vulnerability identification` to maintain accreditation.

## FISMA

The `Federal Information Security Management Act` enforces `security standards` for `government systems`. Organizations must document and prove active `vulnerability management` to maintain `availability`, `confidentiality`, and `integrity`.

## ISO 27001

The `ISO 27001` standard governs `information security management systems (ISMS)` globally. It mandates quarterly `internal` and `external scans` and structured risk-based management practices. `ISO compliance` relies on maintaining effective security processes, not just documentation.

## Penetration Testing Standards

`Penetration testing` must follow defined `scopes`, `rules of engagement`, and `legal contracts` to prevent unintended damage. Tests should demonstrate risk without altering client data.

### PTES

The `Penetration Testing Execution Standard` defines seven stages:  
Pre-engagement, `Intelligence Gathering`, `Threat Modeling`, `Vulnerability Analysis`, `Exploitation`, `Post-Exploitation`, and `Reporting`.

### OSSTMM

The `Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual` provides structured guidance across five `security channels`:  
`Human Security`, `Physical Security`, `Wireless Communications`, `Telecommunications`, and `Data Networks`.

### NIST

The `National Institute of Standards and Technology` defines phases for `penetration testing`: `Planning`, `Discovery`, `Attack`, and `Reporting`. It complements the `NIST Cybersecurity Framework` used for `incident response`.

### OWASP

The `Open Web Application Security Project` sets standards for `web`, `mobile`, and `firmware` testing. Key guides include:  
`Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)`, `Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)`, and `Firmware Security Testing Methodology`.
