# Security Assessments

Every organization performs different types of `security assessments` to identify, confirm, and mitigate vulnerabilities in their `networks`, `computers`, and `applications`. Each method varies based on compliance needs, risk tolerance, and threat environment.

# Vulnerability Assessment

A `vulnerability assessment` is used to detect weaknesses and ensure compliance with specific `security standards`.  
The applied standards depend on factors like `industry regulations`, `network size`, `application type`, and `security maturity`.  
It may be conducted independently or alongside other assessments to improve the organization’s overall `security posture`.

# Penetration Test

A `penetration test` (`pentest`) simulates a `cyber attack` to identify exploitable vulnerabilities under legal authorization.  
Results provide detailed insights to enhance `network security`.

Types of pentests:

- `Black Box` – no prior knowledge of network configurations; simulates an external attacker.
- `Grey Box` – partial knowledge of the network; mimics an internal low-privilege user.
- `White Box` – full access to systems and source code for deep analysis.

Pentest specializations:

- `Application Pentesters` focus on `web applications`, `APIs`, `mobile applications`, and `source code review`.
- `Network Pentesters` assess `network devices`, `servers`, and `Active Directory` environments.
- `Physical Pentesters` exploit `physical security` flaws to gain unauthorized access.
- `Social Engineering Pentesters` test human behavior through `phishing` and `vishing`.

`Pentesting` is suited for organizations with medium to high `security maturity`, established `cybersecurity policies`, `incident response` capabilities, and strong `security culture`.

# Vulnerability Assessments vs. Penetration Tests

Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Tests are two different types of security evaluations with distinct goals and methodologies.

A `vulnerability assessment` identifies weaknesses in a `network` or `system` without simulating real `cyber attacks`. It focuses on detection and documentation, not exploitation. Organizations perform these assessments periodically to ensure compliance with `security standards` like `GDPR` or `OWASP`. The process involves structured checklists such as:

- Do we meet this standard?
- Do we have this configuration?

During a `vulnerability assessment`, an assessor typically runs a `vulnerability scan` and validates `critical`, `high`, and `medium-risk` findings to confirm they’re real, not `false positives`. Validation may involve using secondary tools but stops short of `privilege escalation`, `lateral movement`, or `post-exploitation`. For instance, even if a `remote code execution` issue is found, the assessor only confirms its existence, not exploitability.

A `penetration test` (`pentest`), on the other hand, simulates a `cyber attack` to actively test how a system can be compromised. Depending on the type, it can target different `assets` and evaluate the `impact` of real-world attacks. `Pentests` combine manual and automated methods to analyze an organization’s `security posture` and determine how exploitable discovered vulnerabilities are.

A `pentest` should only follow once `vulnerability assessments` have been completed and the issues addressed. Both can occur within the same year, working together to strengthen defenses. The `vulnerability assessment` identifies weaknesses; the `pentest` tests their real-world exploitability. Neither is superior—they serve complementary roles in overall `cybersecurity`.

# Other Types of Security Assessments

`Security audits` are externally mandated compliance checks (e.g., `PCI-DSS`). Organizations must run `vulnerability assessments` beforehand to ensure compliance and avoid fines or service restrictions.

`Bug bounty programs` invite external testers to report `vulnerabilities` (usually with restrictions like no automated scanning). Large, mature organizations with triage teams benefit most; payouts range from small to huge depending on severity.

`Red team assessments` are evasive, goal-oriented `penetration tests` that simulate real adversaries to reach specific objectives. `Red teams` report the path to the goal, not every finding. Internal `red teams` run continuous campaigns; third-party teams conduct scoped engagements.

`Purple team assessments` combine `red team` and `blue team` efforts so defenders learn in real time. The goal is to enhance `detection`, `incident response`, and `security controls` through active collaboration and iterative improvement.
