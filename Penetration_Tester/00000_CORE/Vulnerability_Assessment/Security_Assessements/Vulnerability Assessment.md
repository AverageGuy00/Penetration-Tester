# Vulnerability

A `vulnerability` is a weakness or flaw in an organization’s `applications`, `networks`, or `infrastructure` that exposes it to potential threats from `external actors`.

Vulnerabilities are cataloged in `MITRE’s Common Vulnerability Exposure (CVE)` database and assigned a `Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)` score to indicate severity.

The `CVSS` framework helps organizations and governments maintain consistent `severity ratings`, prioritize `remediation efforts`, and plan appropriate `response actions`.

Scoring considers metrics such as `attack vector` (network, adjacent, local, physical), `attack complexity`, `privileges required`, `user interaction`, and the potential impact on `confidentiality`, `integrity`, and `availability`.

Scores range from 0 to 10, reflecting the overall `risk level` based on these factors.

# Threat

A `threat` is a process or condition that increases the likelihood of an `adverse event`, such as a `threat actor` exploiting a `vulnerability`.

Some vulnerabilities pose higher `threat levels` depending on the `likelihood of exploitation`. When the `reward` of exploitation is high and the `effort` required is low, the vulnerability becomes a more attractive `target` for attackers.

# Exploit

An `exploit` is any `code` or `resource` designed to take advantage of a `vulnerability` in a system or application.

Exploits can be found in public repositories such as `Exploit-DB` or the `Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database`, and are often shared on platforms like `GitHub` and `GitLab` for research and testing purposes.

# Risk

`Risk` is the possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.

To differentiate the three, we can think of it as follows:

- `Risk`: something bad that could happen
- `Threat`: something bad that is happening
- `Vulnerabilities`: weaknesses that could lead to a threat

# Asset Management

Start by inventorying what you protect. If you don’t know your assets, you can’t defend them. Asset management is the foundation of `defensive security` and `vulnerability management`.

## Asset Inventory

Include every data and device type: `IT` and `OT` hardware, `servers`, `endpoints`, `HDD/SSD`, `external drives`, legacy media, and backups. Track `cloud` storage (`AWS`, `GCP`, `Azure`) and SaaS data (`Google Drive`, `Dropbox`, `Office 365`). Inventory all `applications` (on-prem and SaaS), and all network devices (`routers`, `firewalls`, `switches`, `IDS/IPS`). Classify data and assign access controls.

## Application & System Inventory

Document every app, service, and storage location. Use asset management tools and ensure each asset has a `data classification` and owner. Multi-cloud and third-party SaaS require separate discovery methods and periodic reconciliation.

## Why it matters

Missing assets = blind spots. A single overlooked `backup`, `S3` bucket, or forgotten VM can expose credentials, backups, or sensitive data. Inventory enables prioritized `patching`, accurate `risk assessments`, and effective incident response.
