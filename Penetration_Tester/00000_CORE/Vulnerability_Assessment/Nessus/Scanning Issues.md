# Nessus Scan Best Practices and Mitigation

`Nessus` is a widely used `vulnerability scanning` platform, but it requires caution before execution. Scans can impact `sensitive networks`, trigger `false positives`, or cause `service disruptions`. Always communicate with the `client` or `internal stakeholders` before scanning to determine if any `sensitive`, `legacy`, or `high-availability` hosts should be excluded, scanned separately, or tested outside normal business hours.

Unexpected results can occur and may require fine-tuning.

# Mitigating Issues

Some `firewalls` can cause results showing either all ports open or no ports open. This can be mitigated by creating an **Advanced Scan** and disabling the **Ping the remote host** option. Disabling ICMP prevents Nessus from misinterpreting “ICMP Unreachable” responses as live hosts, reducing `false positives`.

On `sensitive networks`, use `rate-limiting` to minimize performance impact. Adjusting the **Performance Options**, such as lowering **Max Concurrent Checks Per Host**, helps when scanning heavily loaded systems like public web servers.

Exclude `legacy systems` and avoid scanning devices like `printers` to prevent instability. For specific exclusions, use the `nessusd.rules` file to define scan restrictions and host exceptions.

Never enable `Denial of Service (DoS)` checks unless explicitly required. Always activate the **safe checks** option to prevent running destructive plugins. While this does not eliminate all risk, it significantly reduces potential impact and scan time.

Before starting any scan, notify all relevant parties. After completion, maintain detailed `scan logs` for accountability and post-scan investigation if any incident occurs.
