`Vulnerability scanning` is the process of detecting potential `vulnerabilities` across `network devices` such as `routers`, `firewalls`, `switches`, as well as `servers`, `workstations`, and `applications`. Scanning is `automated` and focuses on identifying `known` or `potential vulnerabilities` at both the `network` and `application` levels.

Unlike exploitation, `vulnerability scanners` generally **do not** exploit vulnerabilities (except in rare cases). Human validation is required to confirm whether the identified issues are `true positives` or `false positives`. False positives are then excluded from future scans to improve accuracy.

While `vulnerability scanning` is commonly a component of `penetration testing`, the two are not equivalent. A `vulnerability scan` helps broaden testing coverage or accelerate a `penetration test` when under time constraints. However, a true `penetration test` involves additional manual analysis, exploitation, and post-exploitation steps beyond automated scanning.

Different `vulnerability scanners` employ both `static` and `dynamic` tests depending on the target:

- `Static tests` identify vulnerabilities by matching the detected `software version` against known `CVEs`. These results may be inaccurate if patches have already been applied or the target configuration mitigates the vulnerability.
- `Dynamic tests` send `benign payloads` to simulate attacks such as `weak credentials`, `SQL injection`, or `command injection`. A positive response indicates that the target is likely vulnerable.

Organizations should routinely conduct both `unauthenticated` and `authenticated` scans to ensure continuous visibility over their infrastructure. This ensures that newly discovered vulnerabilities are addressed, and that new assets integrated into the network are properly patched and configured. The findings from `vulnerability scanning` feed directly into an organization’s `patch management` and `risk mitigation` processes.

Common `vulnerability scanning tools` include:  
`Nessus` – a widely used enterprise-grade scanner with a community edition.  
`Qualys` – a cloud-based scanner offering automated compliance and vulnerability management.  
`Nexpose` – a commercial platform by Rapid7 offering a 30-day trial for evaluation.  
`OpenVAS` – an open-source alternative providing extensive community-supported scanning capabilities.
