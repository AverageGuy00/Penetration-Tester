# Nessus Reports

Once a scan is completed we can export it in `.pdf`, `.html`, or `.csv` formats.

The `.pdf` and `.html` reports offer either an **Executive Summary** or a custom report. The **Executive Summary** lists all scanned hosts, the total number of `vulnerabilities` per host, and includes a **Show Details** section that displays the `severity`, `CVSS score`, `plugin number`, and name of each discovered issue.

The `plugin number` links directly to the detailed plugin entry in the `Tenable plugin database`. The `.pdf` format is easier to share, while the `.csv` format allows selecting which columns to export. This makes it useful for importing scan data into tools such as `Splunk`, distributing it among internal teams responsible for `remediation`, or performing further `analytics` on the scan data.

# Nessus Scan Export Formats

`Nessus` allows exporting scans in two additional formats: `.nessus` (`scan.nessus`) and `.db` (`scan.db`).

The `.nessus` file is an `.xml` document that includes the `scan settings` and all `plugin outputs`. The `.db` file contains the `.nessus` file along with the scanâ€™s `Knowledge Base (KB)`, `Plugin Audit Trail`, and any `scan attachments`. These additional components provide deeper insights into scan behavior and history.

More technical details about the `KB` and `Audit Trail` can be found in the official `Tenable documentation`.

Scripts like `nessus-report-downloader` can automate retrieving scan results directly from the CLI using the `Nessus REST API`, enabling faster extraction of all available export formats for analysis or archival.
