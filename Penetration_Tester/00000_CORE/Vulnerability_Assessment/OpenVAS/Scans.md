# OpenVAS Scan Configurations

`OpenVAS` provides multiple scan configurations for different levels of network assessment. Only the configurations below are recommended, as other options may cause `system disruptions` or `network instability`.

`Base`  
This configuration collects basic information about a hostâ€™s status and `operating system`. It performs enumeration only and does **not** check for `vulnerabilities`.

`Discovery`  
This configuration enumerates system details such as `services`, `hardware`, `accessible ports`, and installed `software`. It also does **not** perform `vulnerability checks`.

`Host Discovery`  
This configuration determines whether a host is active on the network. It uses `ping` to identify live hosts but does **not** check for `vulnerabilities`.

`System Discovery`  
This configuration goes beyond the standard `Discovery Scan`, attempting to identify both the `operating system` and `hardware` of the target host for deeper enumeration.

`Full and Fast`  
This is the **recommended** configuration by `OpenVAS`. It safely leverages intelligent selection of `Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)` based on accessible ports, optimizing both accuracy and performance while minimizing risk to the network.

# Exporting Results

`OpenVAS` supports multiple export formats for reporting, including `.xml`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, `.itg`, and `.txt`.

When exporting in `.xml`, the report can be parsed using various `XML parsers` to improve readability and data accessibility. These formats enable flexibility in how `vulnerability data` is reviewed, shared, or integrated into other `security analysis` tools and workflows.

We will export our results in XML and use the [openvasreporting](https://github.com/TheGroundZero/openvasreporting) tool by the TheGroundZero. The `openvasreporting` tool offers various options when generating output. We are using the standard option for an Excel file for this report.
