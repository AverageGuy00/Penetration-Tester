# OpenVAS Overview

`OpenVAS`, developed by `Greenbone Networks`, is a publicly available `vulnerability scanner`. It functions as part of the broader `Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM)` framework, which is also open-source and free to use.

`OpenVAS` supports both `authenticated` and `unauthenticated` network scans, allowing comprehensive assessment of systems. Through its integration with `Greenbone Vulnerability Manager`, it provides centralized management, scheduling, and reporting for discovered `vulnerabilities`, making it a versatile solution for `network security assessments`.
