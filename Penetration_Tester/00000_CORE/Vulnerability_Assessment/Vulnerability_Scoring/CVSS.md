# Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

The `Common Vulnerability Scoring System` is an `industry standard` used to calculate the `severity` of `vulnerabilities`. Many `vulnerability scanners` automatically assign `CVSS scores` to findings, but understanding how these are derived is essential for manual calculation and justification.

`CVSS` is often paired with `Microsoft DREAD`, a `risk assessment` model used to evaluate the `impact` and `likelihood` of `security threats`. `DREAD` scores threats on a 10-point scale based on five key factors:

- `Damage Potential`  
- `Reproducibility`  
- `Exploitability`  
- `Affected Users`  
- `Discoverability`

# Severity Scoring

The `CVSS` system categorizes the `severity` of `vulnerabilities` to help organizations `prioritize remediation` efforts. It evaluates two main components: `exploitability` and `impact`.

`Exploitability` metrics include `access vector`, `access complexity`, and `authentication` requirements.

`Impact` metrics measure how a vulnerability affects the `confidentiality`, `integrity`, and `availability` of systems — collectively known as the `CIA triad`.

The CVSS base metric group represents the vulnerability characteristics and consists of `exploitability` metrics and `impact` metrics.

#### Exploitability Metrics

The Exploitability metrics are a way to evaluate the technical means needed to exploit the issue using the metrics below:

- Attack Vector
- Attack Complexity
- Privileges Required
- User Interaction

#### Impact Metrics

The Impact metrics represent the repercussions of successfully exploiting an issue and what is impacted in an environment, and it is based on the CIA triad. The CIA triad is an acronym for `Confidentiality`, `Integrity`, and `Availability`.

# CIA Impact Breakdown

`Confidentiality Impact` ensures that only `authorized individuals` can access information. A **high** severity case occurs when an attacker steals `passwords` or `encryption keys`. A **low** severity case involves exposure of `non-critical data` that does not significantly affect the organization.

`Integrity Impact` ensures information remains `accurate` and `unaltered`. A **high** severity case occurs when an attacker `modifies essential business files`. A **low** severity case occurs when an attacker can alter data but cannot `control` or `target` specific critical files.

`Availability Impact` ensures that data and systems are `accessible` when needed. A **high** severity case occurs when an attacker causes `complete downtime` or `denial of access`. A **low** severity case occurs when access is `partially disrupted` but core assets remain reachable.

# Temporal Metric Group

The **Temporal Metric Group** defines the availability of `exploits` or `patches` related to a `vulnerability`.

## Exploit Code Maturity

`Exploit Code Maturity` represents the likelihood of a `vulnerability` being exploited based on how easy exploitation techniques are to use.

Metric values: `Not Defined`, `High`, `Functional`, `Proof-of-Concept`, `Unproven`

A `Not Defined` value means the metric is skipped.  
A `High` value means a working `exploit` exists and can be used reliably with automated tools.  
A `Functional` value means publicly available `exploit code` exists.  
A `Proof-of-Concept` value means a PoC `exploit` exists but needs modification before it can be used effectively.  
An `Unproven` value means no working `exploit` is known or available.

## Remediation Level

`Remediation Level` indicates the prioritization and availability of fixes for a `vulnerability`.

Metric values: `Not Defined`, `Unavailable`, `Workaround`, `Temporary Fix`, `Official Fix`

A `Not Defined` value means the metric is skipped.  
An `Unavailable` value means no `patch` exists.  
A `Workaround` value means an unofficial solution exists until an official fix is released.  
A `Temporary Fix` means a vendor provided a temporary solution but not a full patch.  
An `Official Fix` means the vendor has publicly released an official `patch`.

## Report Confidence

`Report Confidence` measures how validated and accurate the technical details of a `vulnerability` are.

Metric values: `Not Defined`, `Confirmed`, `Reasonable`, `Unknown`

A `Not Defined` value means the metric is skipped.  
A `Confirmed` value means multiple trusted sources have verified the `vulnerability`.  
A `Reasonable` value means partial evidence exists, but not enough for full reproduction.  
An `Unknown` value means the `vulnerability` has not been independently verified.

---

# Environmental Metric Group

The **Environmental Metric Group** represents the overall significance of a `vulnerability` to an organization, based on the `CIA triad` — `Confidentiality`, `Integrity`, and `Availability`.

## Modified Base Metrics

`Modified Base Metrics` allow an organization to adjust the impact ratings of `Confidentiality`, `Integrity`, and `Availability` depending on how critical each element is to their operations.

Metric values: `Not Defined`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`

A `Not Defined` value means the metric is skipped.  
A `High` value means one aspect of the `CIA triad` has catastrophic impact on the organization and its customers.  
A `Medium` value means significant but not catastrophic impact.  
A `Low` value means minimal impact on the organization and customers.

## Calculating CVSS Severity

The `CVSS v3.1` score is calculated using all `Base`, `Temporal`, and `Environmental` metrics.  
The `National Vulnerability Database (NVD)` provides a public `CVSS calculator` for determining exact severity scores.

## CVSS Calculation Example

Example: The `Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability` (`CVE-2021-34527`) has a `CVSS Base Score` of 8.8.  
Each `metric value` contributes to the final `severity rating` through the official `CVSS formula`.
