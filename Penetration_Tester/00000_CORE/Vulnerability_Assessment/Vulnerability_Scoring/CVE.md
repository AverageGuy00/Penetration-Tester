# Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)

`Open Vulnerability Assessment Language` (`OVAL`) is an international `information security` standard used to evaluate and describe a system’s current `security state` and existing `issues`.

It is co-supported by the `Office of Cybersecurity and Communications` under the `U.S. Department of Homeland Security`.

`OVAL` provides a standardized `language` for encoding `system attributes` and sharing `vulnerability information` across the `security community`.

The `OVAL Repository` contains over **7000+ definitions** available for public use.

Additionally, `OVAL` is integrated into the `Security Content Automation Protocol` (`SCAP`) developed by the `U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology` (`NIST`).  
`SCAP` combines community-driven methods to automate `vulnerability management`, `security measurement`, and `policy compliance validation`.

## OVAL process

The goal of the OVAL language is to have a three-step structure during the assessment process that consists of:

- Identifying a system's configurations for testing
- Evaluating the current system's state
- Disclosing the information in a report

The information can be described in various types of states, including: `Vulnerable`, `Non-compliant`, `Installed Asset`, and `Patched`.

# OVAL Definitions

`OVAL definitions` are stored in `XML` format to identify `software vulnerabilities`, `misconfigurations`, `installed programs`, and other `system information`—without the need to `exploit` a system.

This allows organizations to detect and correlate which systems in a `network` require `patching` safely and efficiently.

The four main classes of `OVAL definitions` include:

- `OVAL Vulnerability Definitions` — Identify system `vulnerabilities`
- `OVAL Compliance Definitions` — Check if `system configurations` meet `policy requirements`
- `OVAL Inventory Definitions` — Determine if specific `software` is present on a system
- `OVAL Patch Definitions` — Verify whether a system has the correct `patch` installed

The `OVAL ID Format` follows the structure:  
`oval:Organization Domain Name:ID Type:ID Value`

`ID Type` categories include:  
`definition (def)`, `object (obj)`, `state (ste)`, and `variable (var)`.

Example:  
`oval:org.mitre.oval:obj:1116`

`Security scanners` such as `Nessus` can leverage `OVAL` to configure `compliance scanning templates` and assess `system security posture`.

# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

`Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)` is a publicly accessible catalog of known `security issues` maintained under the sponsorship of the `U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)`.

Each identified `vulnerability` or `exposure` receives a unique `CVE ID` assigned by a `CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)`. This system ensures global `standardization` for tracking and referencing specific `security flaws`.

A `CVE entry` includes essential information such as:

- A detailed `description` of the issue
- Relevant `references` or advisories
- Context about potential `impact`

The goal of `CVE` is to provide organizations with consistent, centralized data so IT and security teams can accurately assess the `severity` and `risk` of vulnerabilities within their `environments`.

# Stages of Obtaining a CVE

`Stage 1: Identify if CVE is Required and Relevant`  
Determine whether the issue qualifies as a `vulnerability`. According to the `CVE Team`, a `vulnerability` is any `exploitable code` that negatively affects `confidentiality`, `integrity`, or `availability` and requires a `code change`, `specification change`, or `deprecation` to mitigate. Verify that the issue does not already exist in the `CVE database`.

`Stage 2: Reach Out to Affected Product Vendor`  
Make a good-faith effort to contact the affected `vendor` directly. Researchers can refer to the `CVE Disclosure Practices` documentation for guidance on responsible disclosure.

`Stage 3: Identify if Request Should Be for Vendor CNA or Third-Party CNA`  
If the affected `vendor` is part of a `CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)`, they can assign a `CVE ID` themselves. If not, contact the vendor’s `third-party coordinator` or a participating CNA that handles external requests.

`Stage 4: Requesting CVE ID Through CVE Web Form`  
If the previous methods fail, submit a `CVE ID` request through the official `CVE Web Form` provided by the `CVE Team`.

`Stage 5: Confirmation of CVE Form`  
After submission, the requester receives a `confirmation email`. The `CVE Team` will follow up if additional technical or contextual details are required.

`Stage 6: Receival of CVE ID`  
Once approved, the `CVE Team` issues a `CVE ID` to the requester. The ID remains **non-public** until official disclosure.

`Stage 7: Public Disclosure of CVE ID`  
The `CVE ID` is publicly announced once all relevant `vendors` and `stakeholders` have been informed. This prevents duplication and ensures proper coordination.

`Stage 8: Announcing the CVE`  
When publishing multiple vulnerabilities, each `CVE` must uniquely represent a distinct issue. Researchers should follow CVE publication standards when releasing them.

`Stage 9: Providing Information to the CVE Team`  
Researchers supply detailed information to enrich the `official CVE record`. This data is later published in the `U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD)`, providing full technical and contextual visibility for the security community.
