Over the 15 years of existence of the Metasploit Framework, `Encoders` have assisted with making payloads compatible with different processor architectures while at the same time helping with antivirus evasion. `Encoders` come into play with the role of changing the payload to run on different operating systems and architectures. These architectures include:

|  `x64` | `x86` | `sparc` | `ppc` | `mips` |

# Shikata Ga Nai (SGN)

`Shikata Ga Nai` was once a widely used `encoding scheme` because it made `payloads` hard to detect. Modern `detection methods` have largely closed that gap, so SGN is no longer a universal evasion technique. The name (仕方がない) roughly means “it cannot be helped” — fitting, because reliance on SGN alone is a losing bet today. There are, however, alternate `evasion` methodologies worth exploring beyond simple `encoders`. The FireEye write-up you mentioned is a useful historical reference on why SGN dominated in its era.

- `​`Widely used `encoding scheme` for `payloads` historically
- `​`Modern `detection methods` have reduced SGN’s effectiveness
- `​`SGN’s name: 仕方がない — “it cannot be helped” (apt for its decline)
- `​`Don’t rely on `encoders` alone; combine operational tradecraft and newer `evasion` techniques
- `​`FireEye article is a good deep-dive into SGN’s past strengths and limitations

The `Metasploit Framework` previously separated payload and encoder functionality into two utilities: `msfpayload` and `msfencode`. They lived alongside the console tools in `/usr/share/framework2/` and were used together in pipelines to build and encode custom `payloads` for specific target architectures.

- `msfpayload` — generate a raw `payload` (self-contained or staged).
- `msfencode` — encode the `payload` for the target architecture to evade simple signature checks.
- `/usr/share/framework2/` — typical location of the legacy tools on disk.
- Use a pipe (`|`) to feed output from `msfpayload` into `msfencode` to produce an encoded payload ready for delivery.

Notes: a failed legacy-encoded payload doesn’t mean the `vulnerability` is absent — it often means the `payload`/encoder combo needs tuning for the target. Modern `Metasploit` consolidated these functions into the Framework (via `msfconsole` and integrated payload/encoder handling) after 2015.

```bash

After 2015, updates to these scripts have combined them within the `msfvenom` tool, which takes care of payload generation and Encoding. We will be talking about `msfvenom` in detail later on. Below is an example of what payload generation would look like with today's `msfvenom`:
#### Generating Payload - Without Encoding

```bash

We should now look at the first line of the `$buf` and see how it changes when applying an encoder like `shikata_ga_nai`.

```

Suppose we want to select an Encoder for an `existing payload`. Then, we can use the `show encoders` command within the `msfconsole` to see which encoders are available for our current `Exploit module + Payload` combination.

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set payload 15

payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp


msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > show encoders
