A [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) is an application that runs on the back end server, which handles all of the HTTP traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requested pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser. Web servers usually run on TCP [ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_\(computer_networking\)) `80` or `443`, and are responsible for connecting end-users to various parts of the web application, in addition to handling their various responses.

The following are some of the most common [HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status):
