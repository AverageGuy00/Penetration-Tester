User accounts are created on `local systems` or in `Active Directory (AD)` to let people or programs log in and access resources. When a user logs in, the system verifies their `password` and issues an `access token` that contains their `security identity` and `group memberships`. This token is presented whenever the user interacts with processes.

Accounts let employees or contractors log in, allow services to run under a specific `security context`, and manage access to files, applications, or network shares. `Groups` make administration easier by assigning privileges once to the group instead of each user individually.

In `AD`, account provisioning and management is essential. Most users have at least one account, but IT staff may have multiple. `Service accounts` are common for applications and background tasks. An organization with 1,000 employees may have 1,200+ accounts.

Companies also keep many `disabled accounts` for audit purposes, often placed in OUs like `FORMER EMPLOYEES`, ensuring records are retained while privileges are removed.
