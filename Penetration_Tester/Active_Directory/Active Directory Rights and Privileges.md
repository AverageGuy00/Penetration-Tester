`Rights and privileges` are the cornerstones of `AD management` and, if mismanaged, can easily lead to abuse by attackers or penetration testers. `Access rights` and `privileges` are two important topics in `AD` (and `infosec` in general), and we must understand the difference.

- `Rights` are typically assigned to users or groups and deal with permissions to access an object such as a file.
- `Privileges` grant a user permission to perform an action such as run a program, shut down a system, reset passwords, etc.

`Privileges` can be assigned individually to users or conferred upon them via built-in or custom group membership. Windows computers have a concept called `User Rights Assignment`, which, while referred to as rights, are actually types of `privileges` granted to a user.

# Built-in AD Groups

`AD` contains many default or built-in `security groups`, some of which grant their members powerful `rights` and `privileges` which can be abused to escalate privileges within a `domain` and ultimately gain `Domain Admin` or `SYSTEM privileges` on a `Domain Controller (DC)`.

|         `Account Operators`          |      Members can create and modify most types of accounts, including those of users, local groups, and global groups, and members can log in locally to domain controllers. They cannot manage the Administrator account, administrative user accounts, or members of the Administrators, Server Operators, Account Operators, Backup Operators, or Print Operators groups.       |
|           `Administrators`           |                                                                                                                           Members have full and unrestricted access to a computer or an entire domain if they are in this group on a Domain Controller.                                                                                                                           |
|          `Backup Operators`          | Members can back up and restore all files on a computer, regardless of the permissions set on the files. Backup Operators can also log on to and shut down the computer. Members can log onto DCs locally and should be considered Domain Admins. They can make shadow copies of the SAM/NTDS database, which, if taken, can be used to extract credentials and other juicy info. |

A new user account created in the domain is automatically added to this group.                                                                                                                         |
|         `Enterprise Admins`          |    Membership in this group provides complete configuration access within the domain. The group only exists in the root domain of an AD forest. Members in this group are granted the ability to make forest-wide changes such as adding a child domain or creating a trust. The Administrator account for the forest root domain is the only member of this group by default.    |

| `Preâ€“Windows 2000 Compatible Access` |                                        This group exists for backward compatibility for computers running Windows NT 4.0 and earlier. Membership in this group is often a leftover legacy configuration. It can lead to flaws where anyone on the network can read information from AD without requiring a valid AD username and password.                                        |

# User Rights Assignment

Depending on their `group` membership and `Group Policy (GPO)`, users can be granted `rights` or `privileges` that attackers can abuse. If you can write a `GPO` applied to an `OU` you control (for example via `SharpGPOAbuse`), you can assign highâ€‘impact `rights` like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, or `SeRestorePrivilege`, grant `Log on as a service`/`SeServiceLogonRight`, add accounts to `Restricted Groups` or privileged `group` membership, or deploy a `scheduled task`/startup script that runs as `SYSTEM` â€” all of which enable escalation (dump `NTDS.dit`, dump `LSASS`, create service accounts, etc.). Audit writable `GPOs`, monitor changes to `member` attributes on `privileged groups`, and alert on assignment of dangerous `User Rights Assignment` entries.

|            Privilege            |                                                                                                                         Description                                                                                                                          |
| :-----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight` |                                     This privilege could give our target user the right to log onto a host via `Remote Desktop (RDP)`, which could potentially be used to obtain sensitive data or escalate privileges.                                      |
|       `SeBackupPrivilege`       | This grants a user the ability to create system backups and could be used to obtain copies of sensitive system files that can be used to retrieve passwords such as the `SAM` and `SYSTEM Registry hives` and the `NTDS.dit` Active Directory database file. |
|       `SeDebugPrivilege`        |              This allows a user to debug and adjust the memory of a process. With this privilege, attackers could utilize a tool such as Mimikatz to read the memory space of the `LSASS` process and obtain any credentials stored in memory.               |
|    `SeImpersonatePrivilege`     |          This privilege allows us to impersonate a token of a privileged account such as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This could be leveraged with a tool such as JuicyPotato, RogueWinRM, PrintSpoofer, etc., to escalate privileges on a target system.          |
|     `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`     |                                                         A user with this privilege can load and unload device drivers that could potentially be used to escalate privileges or compromise a system.                                                          |
|   `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`    |                          This allows a process to take ownership of an object. At its most basic level, we could use this privilege to gain access to a `file share` or a file on a share that was otherwise not accessible to us.                           |

# Viewing a User's Priviliges

After logging into a host, typing the command `whoami /priv` will give us a listing of all user rights assigned to the current user. Some rights are only available to administrative users and can only be listed/leveraged when running an elevated `CMD` or `PowerShell` session. These concepts of elevated rights and `User Account Control (UAC)` are security features introduced with `Windows Vista` that default to restricting applications from running with full permissions unless absolutely necessary. If we compare and contrast the rights available to us as an admin in a `non-elevated` console vs. an `elevated` console, we will see that they differ drastically. First, let's look at the rights available to a `standard Active Directory user`.

### Standard Domain User's Rights

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

We can see that the rights are very limited, and none of the "dangerous" rights outlined above are present. Next, let's take a look at a privileged user. Below are the rights available to a `Domain Admin` user.

### Domain Admin Rights Non-Elevated

In a `non-elevated` `CMD` or `PowerShell` session a `Domain Admin` often looks like a regular user because `User Account Control (UAC)` keeps highâ€‘impact `rights` gated until you run an `elevated` shell. This is by design (least privilege): normal processes donâ€™t get full admin `privileges` unless explicitly elevated. To see the true effective rights for an account, run `whoami /priv` in an `elevated` shell â€” thatâ€™s where `Domain Admin` level `rights` appear.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                          State
============================= ==================================== ========
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                 Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
SeUndockPrivilege             Remove computer from docking station Disabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                 Disabled
```

### Domain Admin Rights Elevated

If we enter the same command from an elevated `PowerShell` console, we can see the complete listing of rights available to us.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

`User rights` scale with `group` membership and explicit `privileges`.  

A `Backup Operators` member often has UACâ€‘gated rights (e.g., `SeBackupPrivilege`) that arenâ€™t active in a standard shell, but `whoami /priv` will show `SeShutdownPrivilege` even nonâ€‘elevated â€” meaning they can shut down a `Domain Controller (DC)` if they log on locally (not via `RDP` or `WinRM`).  
This shutdown ability wonâ€™t directly expose secrets, but itâ€™s a highâ€‘impact denial or disruption vector; always audit writable `groups` and UACâ€‘gated `User Rights Assignment`.

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

In `Active Directory`, `rights` granted via built-in `security groups` can significantly impact both attack and defense. Low-privileged users added to these groups can escalate access or compromise the `domain`. Best practice: keep most built-in `groups` empty, only add accounts for specific tasks, and ensure these accounts have strong `passwords`/`passphrases` and are separate from daily-use `sysadmin` accounts. Monitor any membership or extra `privileges` closely.
