`Active Directory` is built around central management and rapid information sharing across large environments. That same design is what makes `Active Directory` `insecure by design`. A default installation lacks many of the `hardening measures`, `security settings`, and `tools` required to properly secure an `AD` environment.

The core issue ties back to the `cybersecurity` balance of `Confidentiality`, `Integrity`, and `Availability` — the `CIA Triad`. In practice, `AD` leans heavily toward `Availability` and `Confidentiality`, which often comes at the expense of `Integrity`.

We can improve `Active Directory` resilience by enabling and adjusting Microsoft’s built-in features to resist common attacks. This is only a baseline — true `defense-in-depth` also requires `asset inventory`, `patch management`, `configuration control`, `endpoint protection`, `security awareness`, and `network segmentation`. The following are core `AD hardening measures` that every organization should implement.

# General Active Directory Hardening Measures

The [Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement.

---

# LAPS

`LAPS` allows local administrator account passwords to rotate on a set interval (e.g., 12 or 24 hours). This limits the damage from a single compromised host in an `Active Directory` environment. On its own, it’s not enough, but combined with other `hardening measures` and `security best practices`, it provides strong protection for local administrator accounts.

---

# Audit Policy Settings (Logging and Monitoring)

`Audit Policy Settings` are essential for logging and monitoring in an `Active Directory` environment. Proper configuration helps detect and respond to suspicious activity, such as unauthorized account or object changes, password modifications, abnormal system access, `password spraying`, or advanced attacks like `Kerberos` exploitation.

---

# Group Policy Security Settings

`Group Policy Objects (GPOs)` are used to enforce `security policies` across users, groups, and computers in `Active Directory`. They are critical for hardening and can include:

`Account Policies` — control domain account behavior (password rules, lockouts, `Kerberos` ticket lifetimes).

`Local Policies` — define host-level settings (audit policies, user rights, account restrictions, device/media use, network access controls).

`Software Restriction Policies` — limit what software can run on a host.

`Application Control Policies` — restrict applications for users/groups (e.g., blocking executables, scripts, Windows Installer). Often implemented with `AppLocker`.

`Advanced Audit Policy Configuration` — monitor actions like file access, account logons, policy changes, and privilege use.

# Update Management (SCCM/WSUS)

`Update Management` is critical for `Windows` and `Active Directory` environments. `WSUS` can be installed on a Windows Server to automate patching, while `SCCM` builds on WSUS to provide broader management features. Automated patching ensures timely deployment and full coverage, reducing the risk of missing critical `security patches`. Manual patching in large environments often leaves systems vulnerable and unpatched.

---

# Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)

`Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)` provide stronger `security` for non-interactive applications, services, and tasks that need credentials. Passwords are automatically generated by the `domain controller` (120 characters) and rotated regularly without user involvement. Credentials can also be used across multiple hosts, reducing the risks tied to traditional service accounts.

---

# Security Groups

`Security Groups` simplify access control in an `Active Directory` environment by assigning rights and permissions at the group level instead of to individual users. Default groups such as `Account Operators`, `Administrators`, `Backup Operators`, `Domain Admins`, and `Domain Users` are created during installation. These groups can also control access to resources like file shares, folders, printers, or documents. Using `security groups` allows for granular, scalable permission management across many users.

# Account Separation

`Account Separation` requires administrators to use two accounts: one for daily tasks and another for privileged work. For example, `sjones` may handle email and documents, while `sjones_adm` is used only on a secure administrative host. This limits exposure if the regular account is compromised (e.g., phishing), preventing attackers from gaining privileged `domain` access. Each account must also use a unique password to reduce the risk of `password reuse` attacks.

---

# Password Complexity Policies + Passphrases + 2FA

`Password Complexity Policies` in `Active Directory` are not enough on their own. Simple passwords like `Welcome1` technically meet complexity rules but are trivial for `password spraying` or offline cracking with tools like `Hashcat`. Stronger approaches include using `passphrases` or long randomly generated passwords managed by an enterprise password manager.

Organizations should enforce a minimum of 12 characters for standard users and longer for administrators or service accounts. Additional controls such as `password filters` (blocking weak words, company names, months, seasons, etc.) help reduce predictable choices.

To further strengthen defenses, `multi-factor authentication (MFA)` should be applied, especially to `Remote Desktop` access, to limit lateral movement through compromised credentials.

---

# Limiting Domain Admin Account Usage

`Domain Admin` accounts should only be used on `Domain Controllers`, never on workstations, jump hosts, or servers. Restricting usage reduces potential attack paths and prevents highly privileged credentials from being exposed in host memory across the environment.

---

# Periodically Auditing and Removing Stale Users and Objects

Organizations should regularly audit `Active Directory` to disable or remove unused accounts. Dormant privileged accounts — for example, a service account created years ago with a weak password — can bypass updated policies and provide attackers with an easy entry point. Such accounts are prime targets for `password spraying`, `lateral movement`, and `privilege escalation` within the `domain`.

---

# Auditing Permissions and Access

Regular audits of `permissions` and `access` are critical in an `Active Directory` environment. Reviews should cover local admin rights, the number of `Domain Admins` and `Enterprise Admins`, file share access, and membership in privileged `security groups`. Limiting unnecessary privileges reduces the attack surface and strengthens overall `security`.

---

# Audit Policies & Logging

Visibility into the `domain` requires strong logging paired with detection rules for anomalous activity. This includes identifying failed login attempts linked to `password spraying`, signs of `Kerberoasting`, or `Active Directory enumeration`. Following Microsoft’s `Audit Policy Recommendations` helps improve detection and response to potential compromise.

---

# Using Restricted Groups

`Restricted Groups` in `Group Policy` allow administrators to enforce specific group memberships across the `domain`. They are commonly used to control membership of local administrators on all hosts, restricting it to the local Administrator account and `Domain Admins`, as well as highly privileged groups like `Enterprise Admins` and `Schema Admins`.

---

# Limiting Server Roles

Avoid installing extra roles on sensitive hosts like `Domain Controllers`. For example, adding `IIS` to a `Domain Controller` increases its attack surface. Roles such as web applications, mail servers, and databases should be separated onto dedicated hosts. Proper `role separation` limits the impact of a successful attack and reduces risk across the environment.

---

# Limiting Local Admin and RDP Rights

Organizations must strictly control local admin rights on computers. Using `Restricted Groups` is one way to enforce this. Granting the entire `Domain Users` group local admin rights on hosts creates a major risk — any compromised account, even low-privileged, could gain local admin access. From there, attackers may extract `sensitive data` or dump `domain credentials` from memory if privileged users are logged in.

The same principle applies to `Remote Desktop (RDP)` rights: allowing broad access increases the chance of data exposure or `privilege escalation`, potentially leading to domain-wide compromise.
